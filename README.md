# job-app-tracker
a way to visualize and organize tech job apps

## Purpose
Application processes are quite similar across many software companies. First is a phone screen, then a technical screen, then the on-site. This makes them easier to keep track of. Some job hunters may be interested in seeing a holistic overview of their search. Potentially interesting data points may be callback rate percentage, number of on-sites, number of offers.

## Technologies
-Frontend: React
-Logic/State: Redux
-Backend: Node.js
-DB: PostgreSQL

Why use React JS? Coming from Ember, I want to try a frontend that does not wrap HTTP requests and form validation by default. It is also agnostic to whatever is going on on the backend.
Why useRedux? A lot of headache can come from including application logic in frontend components, so Redux will keep them separate.
Why use Node.js? It makes server-side rendering easy, which may come in handy for the more intensive UI elements.
Why use PostgreSQL? It has better transactions, SQL features, and just general out-of-the-box usability than MySQL.
